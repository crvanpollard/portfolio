							<p>
								The origins of this map began in November 2019, during a #30daymapchallenge that was conceived by Topi Tjukanov (@tjukanov) on Twitter. I joined this challenge with two objectives in mind: push myself outside of my usual work habits, and experiment with visualizing geospatial data in a different tone - quick, lively, colorful maps that would expand my creative palette. As my daughter so poignantly stated, “Dad is making art with his maps again.” <br><br>

								The original map was conceptually more straightforward, in that it simply depicted the dramatic coastline, along with a few sparse towns. However, what I most enjoyed designing was the gradient-like reflection in the title. I wanted it to feel like the title was melting into the ocean, which, according to scientific evidence, is actually happening to the coastal glaciers on Greenland. Another feature that I was drawn to was the horizontal position of Greenland, as it is a visual that we don’t normally see.<br><br>

								The map received some traction on Twitter, and I even received an email from a Dutch researcher, who was impressed with my map, calling the design “beautiful.” These reactions impacted my decision to keep building upon what I started, but something was missing. I knew I needed some compelling scientific data about ice melt to tell the visual story I had imagined.<br><br>

								I started to explore NSIDC’s datasets and discovered the land ice velocity imagery. I knew right away that this was what I was seeking. I altered the map’s focus to highlight the change of ice velocity occurring at the intersection of the coastal glaciers and the ocean. Initially, I began using softer shades of blue and white to represent dirty melting ice, but I wanted something more striking. With the help of my daughter, we arrived at a teal- to- orange color ramp that helped define and accent the change in velocity. This change can be seen clearly where the glaciers meet the ocean. <br><br>

								Finally, it was time to label the glaciers and other features. Although challenging and very time-consuming, the task of figuring out label placement proved to be the most rewarding part.
								And in the end, our goal as mapmakers is to combine accurate data features with a stunning piece of artwork, to create a visual feast for the eyes.
